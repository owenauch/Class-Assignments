# Free Food Finder MERN App

#### Description:
For our creative project, we decided to use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to build a free food finder for Wash U's campus. The single-page app takes in user events at different locations, displays them on a live map with their details, lists them based on category to help students find events with free food on campus.

### Steps to Use:
* Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/owenauch/Class-Assignments.git```
* Navigate to the ```free_food``` directory
* Run ```npm install``` to install the dependencies
* Run ```npm run dev``` to start the back-end server
* Open a new terminal window
* Run ```npm start``` to open the React front-end
* Create an event and watch it show up on the map!
