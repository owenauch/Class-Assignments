# Free Food Finder MERN App

#### Description:
For our creative project, we decided to use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to build a free food finder for Wash U's campus. The single-page app takes in user events at different locations, displays them on a live map with their details, lists them based on category to help students find events with free food on campus.
