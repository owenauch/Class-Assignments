## CSE 132 -- Computer Science II
### Course Description:
CSE 132 introduces students to fundamental concepts in the basic operation of computers, ranging from desktops and servers to microcontrollers and handheld devices. Subjects include digital and analog input/output, sensing the physical world, information representation, basic computer architecture and machine language, time-critical computation, machine-to-machine communication and protocol design. Students will use both desktop systems and handheld microcontrollers for laboratory experiments. Active-learning sessions are conducted in a studio setting in which students interact with each other and the professor to solve problems collaboratively. 
### Instructor:
Dr. Bill Siever and Professor Douglas Shook
### Languages Used: 
* Java
* Arduino C

## CSE 247 -- Data Structures and Algorithms
### Course Description:
Study of fundamental algorithms, data structures, and their effective use in a variety of applications. Emphasizes importance of data structure choice and implementation for obtaining the most efficient algorithm for solving a given problem. A key component of this course is worst-case asymptotic analysis, which provides a quick and simple method for determining the scalability and effectiveness of an algorithm. Midterm evening exams will be held on the evenings of Monday, 10/2/17 and Monday, 11/6/17 from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Prerequisite: CSE 240
### Instructor:
Dr. Ron Cytron
### Languages Used:

## CSE 330 -- Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming
### Course Description:
This course uses web development as a vehicle for developing skills in rapid prototyping. Students acquire the skills to build a Linux web server in Apache, to write a web site from scratch in PHP, to run an SQL database, to perform scripting in Python, to employ the AngularJS web framework, and to develop modern web applications in client-side and server-side JavaScript. The course culminates with a creative project in which students are able to synthesize the course material into a project of their own interest. The course implements an interactive studio format: after a formal presentation of a topic, students develop a related project under the supervision of the instructor. Prerequisite: CSE 131
### Instructor:

## Math 3200 -- Elementary to Intermediate Statistics and Data Analysis
### Course Description:
An introduction to probability and statistics. Major topics include elementary probability, special distributions, experimental design, exploratory data analysis, estimation of mean and proportion, hypothesis testing and confidence, regression, and analysis of variance. Emphasis is placed on development of statistical reasoning, basic analytic skills, and critical thinking in empirical research studies. The use of the statistical software R is integrated into lectures and weekly assignments. Required for students pursuing a major or minor in mathematics or wishing to take 400 level or above statistics courses. EXAMINATION SCHEDULE: Tests, at which attendance is required, will be given from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on September 12, October 10, and November 14. Prereqs: Math 132. Though Math 233 is not essential, it is recommended.
