## CSE 132 -- Computer Science II
### Course Description:
CSE 132 introduces students to fundamental concepts in the basic operation of computers, ranging from desktops and servers to microcontrollers and handheld devices. Subjects include digital and analog input/output, sensing the physical world, information representation, basic computer architecture and machine language, time-critical computation, machine-to-machine communication and protocol design. Students will use both desktop systems and handheld microcontrollers for laboratory experiments. Active-learning sessions are conducted in a studio setting in which students interact with each other and the professor to solve problems collaboratively. 
### Instructor:
Dr. Bill Siever and Professor Douglas Shook
### Languages Used: 
* Java
* Arduino C

## CSE 247 -- Data Structures and Algorithms
### Course Description:
Study of fundamental algorithms, data structures, and their effective use in a variety of applications. Emphasizes importance of data structure choice and implementation for obtaining the most efficient algorithm for solving a given problem. A key component of this course is worst-case asymptotic analysis, which provides a quick and simple method for determining the scalability and effectiveness of an algorithm. Midterm evening exams will be held on the evenings of Monday, 10/2/17 and Monday, 11/6/17 from 6:30-8:30 p.m. Prerequisite: CSE 240
### Instructor:
Dr. Ron Cytron
### Languages Used: 
* Java

## CSE 330 -- Rapid Prototype Development and Creative Programming
### Course Description:
This course uses web development as a vehicle for developing skills in rapid prototyping. Students acquire the skills to build a Linux web server in Apache, to write a web site from scratch in PHP, to run an SQL database, to perform scripting in Python, to employ the AngularJS web framework, and to develop modern web applications in client-side and server-side JavaScript. The course culminates with a creative project in which students are able to synthesize the course material into a project of their own interest. The course implements an interactive studio format: after a formal presentation of a topic, students develop a related project under the supervision of the instructor. Prerequisite: CSE 131
### Instructor:
